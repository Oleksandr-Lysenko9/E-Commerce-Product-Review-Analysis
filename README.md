## **Project Intent**

This project prioritizes interactive insight delivery through a live dashboard, which presents a concise summary of key results from exploratory analysis, NLP, and predictive modeling. For those seeking technical depth, a full report is also available, detailing the analytical workflow and modeling techniques.

The dashboard is intended as the primary touchpoint for reviewing outcomes and exploring patterns, while the report provides a deeper look into the underlying methods and decisions supporting the analysis.

## **Data Collection**

The product, review, and variant data used in this analysis was sourced via a custom **web scraper** built using Python. The scraper gathers structured data from Shopify-based e-commerce store and stores it in a local SQLite database.

- See the scraping tool: [Web Scraper GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Oleksandr-Lysenko9/Shopify-scraper)
- Scraped data includes product-level data: category, name, size etc., review data: review header, review text, feedback,  and variant-level data: price, color, full product name, etc.

This project uses that scraped data for in-depth analysis, sentiment extraction, and predictive modeling.

## **Results Summary**

- Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key product subcategories, pricing patterns, and customer behavior trends.  
- Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze review sentiments, uncovering gaps between star ratings and textual feedback for deeper customer insights.  
- Built, evaluated, and compared advanced predictive models (Polynomial Ridge, Random Forest, XGBoost) delivering highly accurate sales forecasts.  
- Identified critical sales drivers such as pricing, promotions, customer ratings, and timing, enabling targeted business strategies.  
- Developed an interactive, business-focused dashboard integrating data exploration, sentiment analysis, and sales prediction to empower informed decision-making.  
- Provided actionable intelligence for optimizing marketing, pricing, inventory management, and customer engagement efforts.
